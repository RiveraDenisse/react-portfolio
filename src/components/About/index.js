        I am an electrical engineer (with a computer engineering emphasis)
        currently working for an electric utility. After 10 years of working
        with utilities and consultants I decided it was time to go back to
        computers, so I enrolled on a programming bootcamp to learn and get some
        programming experience. I am currently learning HTML,CSS,
        Javascript,Node.js, React, MongoDB among others. My spare time consists
        of playing video games, watching series/movies and play with my three
        dogs.
